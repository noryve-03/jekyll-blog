Today, I learned about R-CNNs for my internships. I have not done much work with them yet, but I think they are pretty interesting. Here are some resources that I used. 
- [Fast R-CNN Quick Overview](https://blog.paperspace.com/faster-r-cnn-explained-object-detection/) 
- [Understanding and Implementing Faster R-CNN: A step-by-step guide](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-and-implementing-faster-r-cnn-a-step-by-step-guide-11acfff216b0) 

I only got a pretty basic understanding of the algorithms involved. I am planning to learn more in the next few days, so this will be it for today's devlog.
